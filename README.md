# MMM-MyStandings

A [MagicMirror²](https://magicmirror.builders/) module to display standings and rankings for your favorite leagues and divisions from many major sports, including Olympics.  

The module will rotate through different sports.  If you only want to show one sport or one division, the module will just display one without rotating.

This is a fork of the original MMM-MyStandings from user vincep5.  It has been updated with bug fixes, security patches, and many feature additions. 

Intended to match the design aesthetic of, and pair nicely with, [MMM-MyScoreboard](https://github.com/dathbe/MMM-MyScoreboard/).

**These are LEAGUES, not GROUPS**

For any soccer league that does not have any groups, you should list only the league (e.g., `{ league: "English Premier League" }`).  If the soccer league does have groups, listing just the league will rotate through all groups (e.g., `{ league: "FIFA World Cup" }`).  Or you can list the groups you would like to display.

## Logos

You can add your own custom personal logos into the `logos_custom` folder, and they will not be disturbed when you update the module.  [Specific guidance can be found here](https://github.com/dathbe/MMM-MyStandings/tree/4.7.2/logos_custom).  (But if you have a logo that you think should be added for all users, please [share it by opening an issue](https://github.com/dathbe/MMM-MyStandings/issues).)

## Displaying Different Standings in Different Seasons

There are several ways to display standings for a given league only at certain times of year (e.g., hiding it when the league is not in season).  You could use a separate module such as [MMM-ModuleScheduler](https://github.com/ianperrin/MMM-ModuleScheduler), which can display or hide an entire module instance based on your schedule.

Another way to do it is to dynamically create a module with the desired leagues based on the date by adding some javascript to your config.js file, as offered by user [mikeyounge](https://github.com/mikeyounge) in [this discussion thread](https://github.com/dathbe/MMM-MyScoreboard/issues/56).
